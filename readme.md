# Binance AI Trading Bot

**‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: THIS PROJECT IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT!**

This is an open-source project and is still in the development and testing phase. **Using it with real money in live mode is strongly discouraged.** Please conduct comprehensive tests in `mock` or `testnet` modes first. During development, there may be bugs, unexpected behavior, or issues that could lead to financial loss. **Use at your own risk.**

This is an AI-powered, multi-coin cryptocurrency trading bot built with Laravel and FilamentPHP. The system uses configurable AI providers (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, or OpenAI) to make trading decisions across multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously on Binance Futures.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Coin Trading:** Simultaneously manage trades for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- **AI-Powered Decisions:** Utilizes configurable AI providers for intelligent trading decisions.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** A dashboard for live tracking of account balance, positions, and trade history.
- **Filament Admin Panel:** Easily manage bot settings, positions, trades, and AI logs.
- **Configurable Trading Modes:** Supports `mock`, `testnet`, and `live` trading modes.
- **Automated Risk Management:** Includes take-profit and stop-loss mechanisms.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your AI Provider (.env)

The project supports 3 different AI providers. Specify which one you want to use in your `.env` file:

```env
# Option 1: OpenRouter (RECOMMENDED - Flexible and low-cost)
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key

# Option 2: DeepSeek (FASTEST - Direct and very low-cost)
AI_PROVIDER=deepseek
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-key

# Option 3: OpenAI (HIGHEST QUALITY - Powerful but more expensive)
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

### 2. Enable AI

Enable the bot to use AI with the following command:

```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="use App\Models\BotSetting; BotSetting::set('use_ai', true); echo 'AI enabled';"
```

### 3. Start a Trading Cycle!

Initiate a trading cycle with the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/multi-coin/execute
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/multi-coin/execute`: Initiates a trading cycle for all coins.
- `GET /api/multi-coin/status`: Returns the current status of all positions and market data.

### Running the Bot

To manually trigger a trading cycle:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/multi-coin/execute
```

You can add this command to a cron job or a scheduled task for automatic execution.

### Trading Modes

- **`mock` (Default):** Does not connect to a real exchange. It tests with virtual money and simulates price fluctuations.
- **`testnet`:** Uses the Binance Testnet API. It allows you to experience real exchange behavior with test money.
- **`live` (BE CAREFUL!):** Uses real money. Use only after conducting all tests and understanding the risks.

## üìä Monitoring

- **Dashboard:** View real-time balance, recent trades, and P&L (profit/loss) at `/trade-dashboard`.
- **Filament Admin Panel:** Access detailed logs, manage bot settings, and review positions/trades via the `/admin` interface.
- **Log Files:** You can monitor all bot activities in real-time by tailing the log file:
  ```bash
  tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "ü§ñ"
  ```
