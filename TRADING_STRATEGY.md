---

## Core Strategy Components

### 1. AI-Powered Decision Making

**AI Provider**: DeepSeek Chat V3.1 (via OpenRouter)

**Decision Process**:
- AI analyzes market data for all supported coins every 10 minutes
- Reviews technical indicators: EMA, MACD, RSI, ATR, ADX, Funding Rate, Open Interest
- Analyzes both 3-minute (short-term) and 4-hour (long-term) timeframes
- Returns decisions: `buy` or `hold` with confidence score (0-1)

**Confidence Threshold**:
- Minimum confidence: **0.70** (70%)
- Trades with confidence < 0.70 are automatically rejected
- Higher confidence trades historically show better win rates

---

## 2. Fixed Position Sizing

**Strategy**: Use a fixed position size per trade

**Configuration**:
```php
'dynamic_position_sizing' => [
    'enabled' => false,  // DISABLED - Using fixed amount
]

BotSetting::set('position_size_usdt', 30);  // Fixed $30 per trade
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple and predictable position sizing
- No calculation overhead
- Easy to track exact risk per trade

---

## 3. AI-Powered Leverage Selection

**Strategy**: AI analyzes market conditions and selects optimal leverage (2-10x) for each trade

**AI Decision Criteria**:
- **Signal Strength**: Strong technical signals → higher leverage (up to 10x)
- **Volatility (ATR)**: High volatility → lower leverage (2-3x), Low volatility → higher leverage (5-10x)
- **Trend Strength (ADX)**: Strong trend (ADX > 25) → can use higher leverage (7-10x)
- **Confidence Level**: High confidence trades → can justify higher leverage

**Leverage Range**: 2x - 10x (configurable via `max_leverage` setting)

**Examples**:
- **Strong Setup**: Bullish trend + low volatility + ADX > 30 + confidence 0.85 → AI chooses **8-10x**
- **Moderate Setup**: Normal trend + medium volatility + ADX 20-25 + confidence 0.75 → AI chooses **4-6x**
- **Weak Setup**: Choppy market + high volatility + low ADX + confidence 0.70 → AI chooses **2-3x**

**Fallback**:
If AI doesn't specify leverage, system falls back to volatility-based calculation:
- Low volatility → 5x
- Medium volatility → 3x
- High volatility → 2x

**Benefits**:
- AI considers multiple factors simultaneously (volatility, trend, momentum, volume)
- Each coin gets custom leverage based on its specific setup
- More aggressive on high-probability setups
- More conservative on uncertain setups
- Adapts to real-time market conditions

---

## 4. Dynamic Cooldown (Volatility-Based)

**Strategy**: Trade more frequently in fast markets, less frequently in slow markets

**Configuration**:
```php
'dynamic_cooldown' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'low_volatility_minutes' => 120,   // Wait 2 hours
    'medium_volatility_minutes' => 60,  // Wait 1 hour
    'high_volatility_minutes' => 30,    // Wait 30 minutes
]
```

**Logic**:
- After closing a position, bot won't trade the same coin for a cooldown period
- **Low volatility** (slow market): 120 min cooldown (avoid overtrading)
- **Medium volatility**: 60 min cooldown (normal frequency)
- **High volatility** (fast market): 30 min cooldown (capture opportunities)

**Benefits**:
- Prevents overtrading in choppy, directionless markets
- Allows multiple entries in strong trending (volatile) markets
- Reduces trading costs (fees) when opportunities are scarce

---

## 5. Market Cap Diversification (Volatility-Adjusted)

**Strategy**: Limit exposure per market cap segment, adjust based on volatility

**Market Cap Classification**:
```php
'large_cap' => ['BTC/USDT', 'ETH/USDT', 'BNB/USDT']
'mid_cap' => ['SOL/USDT', 'ADA/USDT', 'AVAX/USDT', 'LINK/USDT', 'DOT/USDT']
'small_cap' => ['XRP/USDT', 'DOGE/USDT', 'PEPE/USDT', 'HYPE/USDT', 'ZEC/USDT']
```

**Position Limits**:

**Normal Market Conditions**:
- Max 3 large cap positions
- Max 3 mid cap positions
- Max 4 small cap positions
- **Total**: Up to 10 positions

**High Volatility Conditions**:
- Max 4 large cap positions (increased safety)
- Max 3 mid cap positions
- Max 2 small cap positions (reduced risk)
- **Total**: Up to 9 positions

**Benefits**:
- Prevents concentration risk in one market segment
- Reduces small cap exposure during volatile periods
- Increases stable large cap exposure when markets are risky
- Ensures portfolio diversification

---

## 6. Multi-Level Trailing Stops (Automatic Profit Protection)

**Strategy**: Automatically lock in profits progressively as position becomes more profitable - **NO MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**

### Why Trailing Stops?

You don't need to manually close positions! The system automatically:
- ✅ Protects your profits as they grow
- ✅ Lets winners run to maximize gains
- ✅ Cuts losses early if price reverses
- ✅ Removes emotional decision-making

### The 4 Protection Levels:

**Configuration**:
```php
'trailing_stops' => [
    'level_1' => ['trigger' => 3,  'target' => -1],  // 🛡️ L1: +3% profit → stop at -1%
    'level_2' => ['trigger' => 5,  'target' => 0],   // ✅ L2: +5% profit → stop at 0% (breakeven)
    'level_3' => ['trigger' => 8,  'target' => 3],   // 🔒 L3: +8% profit → stop at +3%
    'level_4' => ['trigger' => 12, 'target' => 6],   // 💎 L4: +12% profit → stop at +6%
]
```

### Visual Example:

**Position: SOL/USDT**
- Entry: $190.21
- Capital: $30
- Leverage: 2x

#### Stage 1: No Protection Yet
```
Entry: $190.21
Current: $192.00 (+0.94%)
Stop Loss: $184.50 (original -3%)
Status: ⚪ No protection yet (need +3% to activate L1)
```

#### Stage 2: 🛡️ Level 1 Activated (+3%)
```
Entry: $190.21
Current: $195.92 (+3.0%)  ← Hit +3%!
Stop Loss: $188.31 (-1%)  ← Moved up from -3% to -1%
Max Loss: Only $0.38 (was $1.80)
Status: 🛡️ T-Stop L1 - Risk reduced!
```

#### Stage 3: ✅ Level 2 Activated (+5%)
```
Entry: $190.21
Current: $199.72 (+5.0%)  ← Hit +5%!
Stop Loss: $190.21 (0%)   ← Moved to breakeven!
Max Loss: $0 (was $0.38)
Status: ✅ T-Stop L2 - CANNOT LOSE ANYMORE!
```

#### Stage 4: 🔒 Level 3 Activated (+8%)
```
Entry: $190.21
Current: $205.43 (+8.0%)  ← Hit +8%!
Stop Loss: $195.92 (+3%)  ← Moved up to +3%!
Min Profit: $1.80 guaranteed
Status: 🔒 T-Stop L3 - Profit locked!
```

#### Stage 5: 💎 Level 4 Activated (+12%)
```
Entry: $190.21
Current: $213.03 (+12.0%) ← Hit +12%!
Stop Loss: $201.62 (+6%)  ← Moved up to +6%!
Min Profit: $3.60 guaranteed
Status: 💎 T-Stop L4 - Big profit locked!
```

#### Stage 6: Price Reverses (Automatic Exit)
```
Price starts falling...
$210 → $205 → $202 → $201.62 ← STOP LOSS TRIGGERED!
Automatic sell executed
Final P&L: +$3.60 (+6% profit locked)
YOU DID NOTHING - System protected your profit! ✅
```

### Real World Benefits:

**Without Trailing Stops:**
```
Entry: $190.21
Peak: $213.03 (+12%)  😃 "Wow, +12% profit!"
Falls: $185.00 (-2.7%) 😭 "Noooo, I lost money!"
Result: -$1.00 loss
```

**With Trailing Stops (L4 Active):**
```
Entry: $190.21
Peak: $213.03 (+12%)  😃 Stop locked at +6%
Falls: $201.62        🤖 Auto-sell triggered
Result: +$3.60 profit ✅
```

### How They Work Automatically:

**Monitoring System** (`php artisan positions:monitor`):
- Runs **every 1 minute**
- Checks all open positions
- Calculates current profit %
- Updates stop loss if level triggered
- Updates Binance stop loss order
- **Never moves stop backwards** (only forward)

**Example Timeline:**
```
00:00 - Position opened at $190.21, stop at $184.50 (-3%)
00:05 - Price $192.00 (+0.94%) - No change
00:10 - Price $195.92 (+3.0%) - ✅ L1 triggered! Stop → $188.31
00:15 - Price $198.00 (+4.1%) - No change (still L1)
00:20 - Price $199.72 (+5.0%) - ✅ L2 triggered! Stop → $190.21
00:25 - Price $203.00 (+6.7%) - No change (still L2)
00:30 - Price $205.43 (+8.0%) - ✅ L3 triggered! Stop → $195.92
00:35 - Price $213.03 (+12%) - ✅ L4 triggered! Stop → $201.62
00:40 - Price $206.00 - No trigger (still above stop)
00:45 - Price $201.62 - 🚨 STOP TRIGGERED! Position closed
```

### Dashboard Indicators:

## 7. Pre-Filtering (Token Optimization)

**Strategy**: Only send coins with promising setups to AI (saves 70% of AI costs)

**Criteria** (Must pass 2 out of 4):
1. **Price > EMA20**: Price above 20-period EMA (uptrend)
2. **MACD > Signal**: MACD line above signal line (bullish momentum)
3. **RSI 35-75**: RSI not oversold or overbought
4. **4H Trend**: 4-hour EMA20 > EMA50 (long-term uptrend)

**Configuration**:
```php
'pre_filtering' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'min_criteria' => 2,  // Must pass at least 2 criteria
]
```

**Example**:
- 15 coins monitored
- 8 coins pass pre-filtering (sent to AI)
- 7 coins filtered out (not sent to AI)
- **Result**: ~50% cost savings + faster decisions

## 17. Example Trade Flow

**Scenario**: BTC/USDT Buy Signal

1. **Market Data Collection** (every 3 minutes)
   - Fetch OHLCV data for BTC
   - Calculate EMA, MACD, RSI, ATR, ADX
   - Store in database

2. **AI Analysis** (every 10 minutes)
   - Pre-filter: BTC passes 3/4 criteria ✅
   - Send BTC data to DeepSeek AI
   - AI returns: `buy`, confidence: 0.85, entry: $95,000, target: $98,000, stop: $93,000

3. **Pre-Trade Validation**
   - Confidence 0.85 > 0.70 ✅
   - Available cash: $1,500 ✅
   - No existing BTC position ✅
   - Cooldown expired (last trade 90 min ago) ✅
   - Large cap limit: 1/3 ✅

4. **Position Sizing**
   - Calculate volatility: ATR ratio = 0.85 → Medium volatility
   - Dynamic leverage: 3x
   - Position size: $1,500 × 2.5% = $37.50
   - Quantity: ($37.50 × 3) / $95,000 = 0.001184 BTC

5. **Order Execution**
   - Set leverage on Binance: 3x
   - Send market buy order: 0.001184 BTC
   - Order filled at: $95,100 (avg)
   - Create position record with targets

6. **Position Monitoring** (every 1 minute)
   - Update current price
   - Check trailing stops:
     - Price reaches $97,954 (+3%) → Move stop to $94,149 (-1%)
     - Price reaches $99,855 (+5%) → Move stop to $95,100 (breakeven)
     - Price reaches $102,708 (+8%) → Move stop to $98,003 (+3%)

7. **Position Exit**
   - Price hits $98,000 (take profit) ✅
   - Close position via market sell
   - Calculate realized P&L: +$2.85 (+2.5% with 3x leverage = +7.5%)
   - Update statistics, cooldown activated
