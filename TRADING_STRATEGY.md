## üéØ UPDATED STRATEGY RULES

### 1. Leverage Rules
```
‚úÖ Max Leverage: 3x (reduced from 10x)
‚úÖ Default: 2x for most trades
‚úÖ High Confidence (80%+): 3x allowed
‚ö†Ô∏è Med-High (75-79%): 2x ONLY (risky range)
‚úÖ Medium (70-74%): 2-3x based on setup
‚úÖ Low (60-69%): 2x maximum
‚ùå Below 60%: REJECT trade
```

**Rationale:**
- 5x leverage caused -$1.18 net loss
- 2x leverage generated +$5.67 profit
- 75-79% confidence is paradoxically risky

### 2. Confidence Filtering
```
‚úÖ 80%+ : IDEAL (100% WR historically)
‚ö†Ô∏è 75-79%: CAUTIOUS (50% WR, cap leverage at 2x)
‚úÖ 70-74%: ACCEPTABLE (41.7% WR but profitable)
‚úÖ 60-69%: ACCEPTABLE (57.1% WR!)
‚ùå <60%  : REJECT
```

### 3. Coin Selection (Active Trading List)
**Primary Coins (Proven Winners):**
- ‚úÖ ZEC/USDT (100% WR, $2.69 profit)
- ‚úÖ HYPE/USDT (100% WR, $2.10 profit)
- ‚úÖ DOT/USDT (100% WR, $1.93 profit)
- ‚úÖ SOL/USDT (33.3% WR but $1.23 profit)
- ‚úÖ BNB/USDT (50% WR, stable)
- ‚úÖ XRP/USDT (62.5% WR, consistent)

**Secondary Coins (Volume + Momentum):**
- ‚úÖ BTC/USDT (Large cap, stable)
- ‚úÖ ETH/USDT (Large cap, stable)
- ‚úÖ LINK/USDT (Mid cap, $233M volume)

**New Additions (High Potential):**
- üÜï SUI/USDT ($334M volume, strong momentum)
- üÜï TAO/USDT ($226M volume, AI sector)
- üÜï ZEN/USDT ($174M volume, 115% weekly gain)

**Excluded Coins:**
- ‚ùå ADA/USDT (0% WR)
- ‚ùå AVAX/USDT (0% WR)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è BCH/USDT (50% WR but net negative)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DOGE/USDT (33% WR, -$0.56)

**Total Active Coins:** 12

### 4. Position Sizing (Fixed - Equal for All Coins)
```
Base Position Size: $10 USDT (same for every coin)
With Leverage:
- 2x leverage = $20 notional
- 3x leverage = $30 notional

Max Positions: 6 simultaneous
Max Capital at Risk: $60 USDT base ($120-180 notional)

Note: No special treatment for any coin. ZEC, XRP, or others
all get the same $10 position size. Let results speak over time.
```

### 5. Trailing Stop Protection (KEEP AS IS - WORKING WELL!)
```
Level 1: +3% profit ‚Üí Move stop to -1%
Level 2: +5% profit ‚Üí Move stop to 0% (BREAKEVEN)
Level 3: +8% profit ‚Üí Move stop to +3%
Level 4: +12% profit ‚Üí Move stop to +6%
```

**Rationale:** Trailing L3 had 100% WR and +$3.96 profit!

### 6. Risk Management
```
‚úÖ Max 1 position per coin
‚úÖ Max 6 total positions
‚úÖ Skip trades if cash < $10
‚úÖ Stop loss at -3% (base) adjusted by leverage
‚úÖ Take profit at +5% (base) adjusted by leverage
```

### 7. Market Cap Diversification
```
Large Cap (BTC, ETH, BNB): Max 3 positions
Mid Cap (SOL, LINK, DOT, TAO, ZEN): Max 3 positions
Small Cap (XRP, DOGE, HYPE, ZEC, SUI): Max 4 positions
```

**High Volatility Adjustment:**
```
Large Cap: Max 4 positions (increase)
Mid Cap: Max 3 positions (same)
Small Cap: Max 2 positions (reduce risk)
```
